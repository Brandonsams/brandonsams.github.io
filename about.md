We provide traffic signal predictive analytics for vehicles as they drive about many cities across the United States and Canada. Requires an in depth understanding of IT, System Administration, Mathematics, and Traffic Engineering.

On a day-to-day basis, I work in .NET, Python, SQL, and PowerShell.

Vehicle-To-Infrastructure communication is quickly growing as a source of analytics. I am thrilled to be doing my part in supporting this fast moving, highly scalable industry.
