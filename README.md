## Recent Projects

### Prime Number Detection

[Prime Number Detection](https://brandonsams.github.io/PrimeDetection-ML)

This project aimed to examine how well machine learning and neural networks would perform when trying to detect if a number was prime. A binary representation of a number was fed in as input, and a model was trained to detect if that number was prime or not.

### Face Mask Detection

[Face Mask Detection](https://brandonsams.github.io/FaceMaskDetection-ML)

Image Processing project that aimed to build a model that could determine if a face in an image was wearing a mask, not wearing it, or wearing it incorrectly. This ternary classifer was built using tensorflow and keras.

### EP Means Clustering of Flight Data

[EP Means Clustering of Flight Data](https://brandonsams.github.io/EPMeans-Flights)

Implemented an algorithm that could cluster distributions of data, rather than basic data points. Relied on computing the distance between distributions, (Earth Mover's Distance), and centroid computation to cluster airline routes by duration. 

### Airline Safety

[Airline Safety](https://github.com/Brandonsams/AirlineSafety)

Data visualization project, where Tableau, Python, and R were used to visually illustrate how safe airline travel is, and how much safer it has been getting.

### Bluetooth Travel Sensors in Austin, TX

[Bluetooth Travel Sensors](https://github.com/Brandonsams/BluetoothTravelSensorsAustin)

Bluetooth sensors were used to track traffic as it flowed around Austin, TX. This project dug into that dataset, and modeled traffic flow during different times of the day, and on different days of the week.
