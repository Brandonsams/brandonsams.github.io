## Work Experience

**Traffic Technology Services**:  2018 - Present

I began in Operations at TTS, but was promoted to Software Developer and eventually Data Scientist. We predict traffic signal behavior, and send the predictions to vehicles that are approaching those intersections.  This requires extensive knowledge of Windows Server Administration, Database Management, Advanced Traffic Management Systems and Traffic Controllers, and of course, Predictive Analytics.
